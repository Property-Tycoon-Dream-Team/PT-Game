Watson Games are a company that produces a range of traditional board games. You have been 
appointed as a software contractor to develop a computer game version of their most popular title 
Property Tycoon, a property trading game similar to the classic Monopoly. Watson Games have 
never commissioned such a system before and so do not have a formal requirements document to 
specify how the software should operate. They do however, have over 60 years of experience 
developing and marketing board games and have put together a set of user requirements to 
describe in their own terms what they want the system to do. This document contains all their user 
requirements. It is possible these requirements might evolve as the project progresses, but the core 
themes of the requirements will not change. You should, however, design with flexibility in mind.
